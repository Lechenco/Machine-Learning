# Machine-Learning

## The Complete Machine Learning Course with Python

Inside the course, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a Python development environment correctly

- Gain complete machine learning tool sets to tackle most real world problems

- Understand the various regression, classification and other ml algorithms performance metrics such as R-squared, MSE, accuracy, confusion matrix, prevision, recall, etc. and when to use them.

- Combine multiple models with by bagging, boosting or stacking

- Make use to unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering etc. to understand your data

- Develop in Jupyter (IPython) notebook, Spyder and various IDE

- Communicate visually and effectively with Matplotlib and Seaborn

- Engineer new features to improve algorithm predictions

- Make use of train/test, K-fold and Stratified K-fold cross validation to select correct model and predict model perform with unseen data

- Use SVM for handwriting recognition, and classification problems in general

- Use decision trees to predict staff attrition

- Apply the association rule to retail shopping datasets

- And much much more!
